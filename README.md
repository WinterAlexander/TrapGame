But you have to specify the version and if you want the Server or not. Please tell 
me if any is broken.

It is a copy of BlockFarmers, a game-plugin I made on Minecraft.
However, this is NOT a Minecraft project, TrapGame is just taking
the concept of BlockFarmers and put it independent in his own client
with his own server.

How to play:
There's a board with a defined size and each player has his own color.
First you can click any square on the board if the square hasn't already
been clicked by another player. After your first click you can only click
on adjacent squares to make your territory bigger. The winner is the player
with the more territory.

Example of play: (BlockFarmers: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAfJ4Ot8nkk)
