                Tips & Strategy
            </h1>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    As with mouse buttons, Space bar and keys W & E can be used to click on buttons.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Auto-filling only works if all players started playing.
                </li>
                <li>
                   Do not start games in center ! You will be surrounded from all sides. A better strategy is to start from one side and go to the middle.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h1>
                Commands (advanced)
            </h1>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Some commands are available in games. They can kick a player with a bad behavior, change the board size or even show a player's statistics.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To show the list of commands in your game chat, type "/list". The list will be shown only for you.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To find how a command works and what's it's purpose, type "/help command" replacing "command" by your actual command.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To get access to the most important commands, you need to be a super user. If you host a game, you will be the super user of your game.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you are a super user, you can share your permissions with other players with the command "/superuser player" where player is the player you want to give permissions.
